# Responsible Disclosure Policy
_Version 2.0 | 17 September 2020 | Breaches[]().uk_

***DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION: PUBLIC***

# 1 Preamble

If you are a researcher, for a quick start, please review the following
sections first:

-   Commentary, section 2.1
-   Principles, section 3.1.2.1
-   Process, section 3.2.2

## 1.1 Breaches[]().uk Mission

TurgenSec runs the public breach reporting community, Breaches[]().uk. The
Breaches[]().uk Team receives details of publicly exposed data, where that
exposure is believed to be unintended or otherwise improper. The Team
enables data subjects to assert their rights.

Note that projects such as OpenBugBounty protect organisations through
the submission of technical flaws that may or may not have been
exploited. Breaches[]().uk protects data subjects by managing data relating
to exploited flaws. This includes notifying data custodians and
assisting where possible with remediation.

The Team observes and promotes strong ethical principles in relation to
personal data. The objective is to bring data exposure to the attention
of the affected parties --data subjects and data custodians and to
apprise data subjects of their rights. Data subjects may thus take steps
to protect themselves against fraud, identity theft and other forms of
attack and further exercise their legal rights. Data custodians can
ensure the data is no longer publicly accessible and that data subjects
are appropriately notified and any concerns addressed.

All honest parties should avoid and reduce the leak of personal data
into the dark web, underground forums and other communities. In such
places personal data may be curated, traded and used systematically to
exploit data subjects. When data custodians respond positively and
promptly to breaches, remedying defects and removing public access, the
data concerned is placed out of the future reach of those with malicious
intent.

The Team endeavours to contact data subjects and data custodians
affected by breaches in a timely and consistent fashion. Though the Team
is not responsible for the response (or lack of response) from notified
parties, all reasonable communication efforts are made, in order to
achieve the aims of this policy. This includes public disclosure where
private disclosure is unfruitful, thus placing the rights of data
subjects first and foremost.

This policy supports the Team's commitment to openness in process and
motivation. The Team aims to work with all parties to create a more
secure digital world where data rights are upheld, with data subjects'
information handled in a secure and transparent manner.

To contact the Team regarding this discovery and disclosure practice,
please email [diclosures@breaches.uk](mailto:disclosures@breaches.uk).

## 1.2 Scope

This policy sets out the Team's approach to disclosing security and data
breaches to third parties and the public. It governs all such breaches,
wherever discovered, worldwide, that are reported through the
Breaches[]().uk reporting service.

## 1.3 Objectives

a)  The **lawful, timely discovery** of datasets containing personal
    information wrongly disclosed publicly, whether inadvertently or
    maliciously.

b)  The **protection of the rights of data subjects** -- in particular
    the right to privacy enshrined in data protection legislation
    internationally.

c)  **Facilitating data subjects' exercise of their rights**, through
    strategic partnerships with law firms.

d)  **Timely and consistent communication** with data custodians found
    to be suffering from a security or data breach, however caused.

e)  **The application of fair and ethical standards**, which balance the
    rights of data subjects and data custodians.

f)  **The promotion of transparency** from data custodians to data
    subjects in relation to the extent and content of breached data.

g)  **Adherence to the letter and spirit of legislation** protecting
    personal data and the rights of individuals.

## 1.4 Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
| :- | :- |
| **Data custodian** | The person or organisation processing, storing or transmitting information pertaining to data subjects. |
| **Data subject** | The person to whom data relates. |
| **Publicly accessible** | Not depending on secret/hidden credentials in order to obtain access. |
| **Publicly exposed** | Publicly accessible data that ought not to be so. |
| **Researcher** | In this policy, a researcher is a person or organisation that discovers a data breach. |
| **The Team** | The team running the Breaches[]().uk breach reporting community. |

# 2 Disclosure

The Team is committed to *private* and *public* disclosure of data
breaches. Private disclosure (to data custodians) aims to provide the
maximum opportunity to remedy breaches and address the concerns of data
subjects. Public disclosure, preferably in partnership with the data
custodian, offers maximum opportunity for data subjects to become aware
of breaches and to protect their interests.

## 2.1 Researcher disclosure

Responsible disclosure processes are initiated at the point a researcher
notifies a breach to the Team, using the Breaches[]().uk service. Disclosure
follows this broad pattern:

a)  Researchers discover breached data.

b)  Researchers commit to following this policy.

c)  Researchers gather breached data and submit to Breaches[]().uk with
    explanatory and contextual information.

d)  Researchers may elect to be named, or to remain anonymous for any
    length of time (including indefinitely).

e)  Researchers need not provide any identifying information to the Team
    and the Team will take steps to ensure that anonymity is maintained
    where desired.

f)  Where researchers wish to be named, the Team will do so during
    public disclosure.

Researchers are credited (if they wish) with the breach, without risking
the sometimes frustrating or time-consuming communication with data
custodians. Researchers may remain anonymous for as long as they wish
(days, years or forever). Researchers may initially disclose through an
alias and later reveal their identities, or vice versa.

# 2.2 Private disclosure

Personal information is sometimes made publicly available in a manner
not intended by the data custodian. Disclosing such discoveries to data
custodians encourages and facilitates remedial action and damage
limitation.

The Team prizes cooperation and collaboration with data custodians.
Irrespective of the nature of communication during private disclosure,
the Team is committed to honest and transparent dealings and will not
make false or misleading statements about data custodians or the events
that transpire throughout the disclosure process.

The preferred outcome will always be:

a)  The Team privately discloses the breach to the data custodian.

b)  The data custodian remedies the breach in a timely manner, to
    minimise exposure.

c)  The Team and the data custodian agree the manner, content and timing
    of public disclosure.

# 2.3  Public disclosure

The Team issues public disclosure notices, preferably with the
cooperation of the data custodian because:

a)  Public disclosure assists in bringing the breach to the attention of
    data subjects including those who are otherwise difficult to
    identify, locate or contact.

b)  When it is impossible to identify the data custodian, public
    disclosure is the only realistic option for alerting data subjects.

c)  When it is impossible to identify the data custodian, data subjects
    may be able to assist with identifying the source of the breach.

d)  Public disclosure supports the transparency objective and promotes
    trust.

e)  Public disclosure raises awareness and scrutiny of breaches.

f)  Public disclosure helps prevent the spread of breach disinformation.

**The Team urges breached organisations to issue their own public
disclosure notices. The Team offers *gratis* guidance and assistance in
this endeavour.**

# 3 Policy

## 3.1 Principles

### 3.1.1 General
a)  The data protection and privacy rights of data subjects are
    fundamental human rights, as enshrined in articles 11, 18 and 19 of
    the [UN Declaration of Human
    Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/).

b)  The data protection principle of minimisation is observed.

c)  Disclosure and discovery are not financially motivated.

d)  Notwithstanding above, to support the longevity and commercial
    viability of the Breaches[]().uk platform, the Team may receive a
    referral fee when a data subject engages a law firm mentioned on the
    platform.

e)  Such law firms will have appropriate expertise and experience.

f)  Bribery and coercion are forbidden.

g)  Data belonging to the military or government of any country is not
    eligible for responsible disclosure and will not be accepted.

### 3.1.2 Discovery

#### 3.1.2.1 Researchers

The Team urges all those reporting breaches to abide by the following
principles:

a)  **Data belonging to the government or military of any country is not
    eligible for this process.**

b)  Discovery activities must be lawful and limited to publicly
    accessible resources.

c)  Discovery activities must not affect or interfere with the normal
    operation and use of the systems and data involved.

d)  Researchers must limit their view of breached data as far as
    practicable. It is understood that some visibility is necessary to
    the triage process, to understand type, extent and risks.

e)  Researchers' submissions to Breaches[]().uk may be anonymous or
    identified, at the researcher's sole discretion.

#### 3.1.2.2 The Team

a)  On receiving notification of a potential breach, Breaches[]().uk staff
    will satisfy themselves that this is a breach of personal data. This
    includes using automated tools to extract metadata and checking
    elements within the dataset to confirm its nature and content.

b)  The Team will make reasonable efforts to discover the identity of
    data custodians.

c)  In accordance with the Breaches[]().uk privacy statement, the Team will
    retain all data submitted to the Breaches[]().uk platform that is
    identified as breached data, for the purpose of allowing individuals
    to confirm whether they were affected by the breach.

**For the avoidance of doubt, the Team does not engage in cracking,
brute force password attacks or any other 'black hat' techniques and
researchers are forbidden from engaging in these methods.**

### 3.1.3 Disclosure

a)  Disclosure will be as timely as resources permit.

b)  Private disclosure precedes public disclosure wherever feasible.

c)  The Team will make reasonable efforts to bring breaches to the
    attention of data custodians.

d)  On notifying organisations of a breach, the Team will wait a
    reasonable period (normally between 7 and 30 days) before publicly
    disclosing the fact of the breach. What is *reasonable* depends on
    the circumstances of the breach and sensitivity of the data
    involved.

e)  If it is not possible to identify the data custodian, in the
    interest of protecting those individuals, the Team will publicly
    announce the details of the breach.

f)  The Team will not request financial compensation from the data
    custodian for its disclosure; neither will it accept payment in
    return for suppressing information about the breach.

g)  In disclosure efforts, the Team may engage the assistance of
    reputable and/or official third parties, such as security
    researchers, lawyers, media, or law enforcement agencies.

h)  If in the view of the Team, data custodians fail to act sufficiently
    swiftly or adequately, the Team will publicly announce the details
    of the breach.

i)  Where a data custodian's response is appropriate, the Team will work
    to develop mutually acceptable public notices of breach, provided
    that the Team will always favour full disclosure.

j)  Public disclosure will where possible include the identity of the
    data custodian, the type of data breached, the technology affected,
    the length of time the dataset was exposed and the number of data
    subjects involved.

### 3.1.4 Data custodians

a)  Data custodians are expected to respond positively and expeditiously
    to the Team's private disclosure.

b)  Data custodians may engage the Team's consultancy and security
    services on a commercial basis, but are under no obligation to do
    so. Such services are independent of disclosure and do not influence
    the timing, tone or content of any public disclosure by the Team.

c)  During the waiting period referred to in section 3.1.3 above data
    custodians should immediately close the breach and then satisfy
    themselves of the fact and circumstances of the breach and the
    veracity of the Team.

d)  Data custodians are expected to follow notification obligations laid
    out in data protection legislation, in particular the duty to notify
    the data protection authority (the [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/) in the
    UK).

e)  As soon as practicable following private disclosure, data custodians
    are expected to notify data subjects of the breach and their rights.
    The Team will at no cost assist with this, if required.

f)  To enhance consumer confidence and preserve reputation, data
    custodians should disclose the breach publicly, incorporating
    assurances in relation to remediation and process improvement.

g)  In its own notice of breach, the data custodian should prominently
    give due credit to the Team for bringing the breach to its
    attention.

## 3.2 Process

### 3.2.1 Overview

The process will vary with each incident, depending on the
circumstances. The following is a representative model process:

a)  A researcher reports a breach to the Team.

b)  The Team verifies the breach

c)  If not already known, the Team identifies the data custodian

d)  The Team contacts the data custodian, through officially published
    communication channels, with brief information, requesting
    appropriate contact details for further discussion.

e)  Following a positive response from the data custodian, the Team
    establishes secure communication channels and provides full details
    about the breach.

f)  If data custodian fails to respond positively, successive
    communication attempts follow an escalating pattern.

g)  The data custodian expeditiously closes the breach and informs data
    subjects.

h)  The Team and the data custodian liaise regarding mutual public
    disclosure notices.

i)  The Team and the data custodian issue public disclosure notices.

j)  The data custodian undertakes such remedial work as is required.

### 3.2.2 Researcher disclosure

The process for researchers making disclosures is as follows:

a)  Submit breached data in a single ZIP or 7Z file containing a
    *README.txt* file and a *data* folder.

b)  Put as much information about the data as possible in the
    *README.txt.* See suggested format in the section below.

c)  Optionally (but this is very helpful) include screenshots or other
    approaches to help explain the dataset.

d)  Upload the file to one of our preferred cloud providers (for the
    list, see section below).

e)  Email the submission to [diclosures@breaches.uk](mailto:disclosures@breaches.uk).

f)  Optionally encrypt submissions with the Team's public key, available
    at section below.

**The Team does not publish information about researchers unless
explicitly authorised by the researcher themselves.**

The Team will normally keep researchers updated on the progress of
breach disclosure. Researchers may opt out from such communication,
however.

#### 3.2.2.1 README.txt format

The README.txt file should contain:

-   Brief description of the data.

-   Date of discovery.

-   Approximate of the data set size

-   Approximate of the number of data subjects

-   Any other comments about the seriousness or origin of the data.

Suggested format, with example data:

```
# Data type
Usernames and passwords

# Data format
TXT

# Company Impacted
Johnsons Commercial

# Date of discovery
12/10/2019

# Size
~3GB

# People Impacted

I wish to take public credit for this breach under the name
[researcher]. You may contact me at this address [researcher@address].
```

#### 3.2.2.2 Accepted file transfer service providers

The Team prefers to receive researchers' file submissions via one of:

-   [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)
-   [Mega.nz](https://mega.nz/)
-   [Anon Files](https://anonfiles.com/)
-   [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
-   [AnonymousFiles](https://anonymousfiles.io/)
-   [GoFile](https://gofile.io/)
