## 2.3 Breaches[]().uk platform

The Platform collates information about data breaches, where data
subjects' data has inappropriately been made publicly available. The
circumstances of a breach usually involve mistake or misconfiguration.

Breach data is collated from submissions by researchers. Researchers
uncover breaches and report these through the Platform.

Breaches submissions are subject to a responsible disclosure process.
Once a breach has reached the point of public disclosure, the Platform
automatically notifies affected subscribers to the Platform (provided it
is possible to correlate the subscriber with the breached data).

The data submitted to the Platform will invariably include personal
information. Depending on the source of the breach, it may also include
special category personal information or criminal offence data.

# 3 Purposes & legal bases

## 3.1 Website visitors

The Team uses personal information relating to website visitors for the
purposes of business administration, development, and promotion. This is
based on the legitimate interests of the business. The Team will not use
personal information for the business's legitimate interests where an
individual's interests and rights override those business interests.

## 3.2 Employees, customers, suppliers & partners

The Team uses personal information relating to customers, suppliers,
partners and their employees for the purposes of business
administration, development, and promotion. Legal bases for this use
vary according to circumstances:

-   For individuals under contract, the primary basis is performance of
    that contract. Without the relevant personal information, it may be
    impossible to provide the associated services.
-   In all cases usage may be based on the legitimate interests of the
    business or the legitimate interests of a third party such as
    customers.
-   For employees of customer, suppliers and partners, usage may be
    based on the legitimate interests of the business or the legitimate
    interests of a third party such as customers.

The Team will not use personal information for the business's legitimate
interests where an individual's interests and rights override those
business interests.

## 3.3 Breaches[]().uk platform

The Platform uses personal information to manage disclosure of data
breaches and to keep data subjects informed. This use is based on the
following grounds:

-   In the case of use of the Platform by a public body or law
    enforcement agency, for the performance of a task carried out in the
    public interest or official authority.
-   In relation to special category or criminal offence personal
    information, to establish, exercise or defend of legal claims; to
    prevent or detect unlawful acts; and for reasons of substantial
    public interest (including notification of breaches and thus
    limiting the availability of breached data to those with criminal
    intent).
-   For the legitimate interests of the business and customers.

The Team will not use personal information for the business's legitimate
interests where an individual's interests and rights override those
business interests.

## 3.4 Legal obligations

The Team uses personal information when are required to do so by law. In
such cases, the legal ground is that the use of personal information is
necessary to comply with a legal obligation.

## 3.5 Marketing

# 4 Data storage and retention

secure this data.
