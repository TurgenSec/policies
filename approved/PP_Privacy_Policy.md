# 1. Introduction
This privacy notice informs you what to expect us to do with your personal information when you make contact with us, use one of our services or if we discover it openly available on the internet as part of our research. It is based on the privacy notice provided by the ICO, found here: ICO Privacy notice.

We’ll tell you:
- why we are able to process your information;
- what purpose we are processing it for;
- whether you have to provide it to us;
- how long we store it for;
- whether there are other recipients of your personal information;
- whether we intend to transfer it to another country; and
- whether we do automated decision-making or profiling.

# 2. Policy
## 2.1 Controller’s Contact Details
TurgenSec Ltd is the controller for the personal information we process, unless otherwise stated (for example in the cases where we discover exposed personal information under the control of other third parties). You can best contact us by email, or phone.
For general contact please refer to https://turgensec.com/contact.
## 2.2 Data Protection Officer’s Contact Details
Our Data Protection Officer is George Punter. You can contact our DPO at dpo@turgensec.com.

Our DPO is responsible for making sure that our business processes and decision making are in line with data protection legislation (including GDPR and the Data Protection Act) and good practice.

## 2.3 How do we get information?
We collect personal data relating to our customers, the employees of our customers and other individuals we work with such as job applicant interviewees. This personal data includes:

- Name, address, contact details
- Position and company
- Professional social media (for example, LinkedIn and Twitter)
- Order history and payment details
- Records of contact and correspondence
- Applications and CVs.

We receive this information directly from individuals or from their companies or the companies we work with.
 
We also receive personal information indirectly, in the following scenarios:
- We have contacted an organisation about a data breach and they give us your personal information in their response.
- Your personal information is contained in breaches of data protection law (‘breach reports’) that we discover and are in the process of disclosing to appropriate parties.
- An employee of ours gives your contact details as an emergency contact or a referee.
 
If it is not disproportionate, prejudicial or a threat to others’ privacy, we’ll contact you to let you know we are processing your personal information.
### 2.3.1 DataShadow
We operate an Intelligence & Digital Risk Protection solution called DataShadow, part of the functionality of which alerts our customers to information security breaches relating to their data. To identify breaches, DataShadow monitors and collects a wide range of information from surface, Deep and Dark Web sources including Tor sites, IRC chat rooms, forums and text repository sites.

In the interests of protecting our customers, DataShadow primarily seeks to identify information free available on the Internet relating to our customers such as:
- Personal details (e.g. addresses, relationships, personal history)
- Compromising material (e.g. search history, post history, message history)
- Usernames and passwords
- Trade secrets and commercial information
- Intellectual property

Due to the wide range of information collected to identify breaches effectively, DataShadow may routinely collect data that includes personal data, special category personal data or criminal offence data. This personal data includes data relating to our clients and any other personal data that is included in the sources DataShadow monitors.

DataShadow alerts our customers when it identifies personal data or other information relating to them. Our customers can then access the personal data relating to them and decide how to use it.

## 2.4 Your Data Protection Rights
Under data protection law, you have rights we need to make you aware of. The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your information. You can read more about these rights here: https://ico.org.uk/global/privacy-notice/your-data-protection-rights/.

Please note that we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before we comply with your request. This is to protect your privacy and to ensure that another person cannot fraudulently make such a request.
### 2.4.1 Your right of access
You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information. This right always applies. There are some exceptions, which means you may not always receive all the information we process.

You can read about these exceptions here: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions

### 2.4.2 Your right to rectification
You have the right to ask us to rectify information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete. This right always applies.

### 2.4.3 Your right to erasure
You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in circumstances where that information is not retained for a superseding purpose.

### 2.4.4 Your right to restriction of processing
You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your information in certain circumstances.

### 2.4.5 Your right to object to processing
You have the right to object to processing if we are able to process your information because the process forms part of our public tasks, or is in our legitimate interests.

### 2.4.6 Your right to data portability
This only applies to information you have given us. You have the right to ask that we transfer the information you gave us from one organisation to another, or give it to you. The right only applies if we are processing information based on your consent or under, or in talks about entering into a contract and the processing is automated.

You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. We have one month to respond to you. Please contact us at dpo@turgensec.com if you wish to make a request for your information.

## 2.5 How long do we keep your information?
### 2.5.1 Our site
We only store personal data collected via Our Site while it is needed for our business purposes up to a maximum of 36 months. We will only keep personal data collected via Our Site for longer where necessary to comply with our legal obligations or to safeguard our legal rights.

### 2.5.2 Our customers and people we work with
We will generally store personal data that is related to our customers or other people we work with for a maximum of 36 months from our last relevant contact. We will only keep personal data relating to customers or other people we work with for longer where necessary to comply with our legal obligations or to safeguard our legal rights.

### 2.5.3 DataShadow
All personal data collected by DataShadow is stored for 36 months before automatic deletion.

Where you request personal data relating to you to be removed from our system, please note it may take up to 28 days for this process to be completed.
## 2.6 Sharing your information
We will not share your information with any third parties for the purposes of direct marketing.

We use data processors who are third parties who provide elements of services for us. We have contracts in place with our data processors. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will not share your personal information with any organisation apart from us. They will hold it securely and retain it for the period we instruct. 

In some circumstances we are legally obliged to share information. For example under a court order or where we cooperate with supervisory authorities, e.g. the ICO, in handling data protection breach reports, complaints or investigations. We might also share information with other regulatory bodies in order to further their, or our, objectives. In any scenario, we’ll satisfy ourselves that we have a lawful basis on which to share the information and document our decision making and satisfy ourselves we have a legal basis on which to share the information.

## 2.7 Links to other websites
Where we provide links to websites of other organisations, this privacy notice does not cover how that organisation processes personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy notices on the other websites you visit.

## 2.8 Children’s Information
We do not provide services directly to children or proactively collect their personal information. However, we sometimes discover information about children in publicly accessible databases through our day-to-day research. The information in the relevant parts of this notice applies to children as well as adults.

This privacy notice is based on the privacy notice provided by the ICO, which was approved for clarity by the Plain Language Commission, and we have made efforts to write the edits in a similar way. We believe a person with a reading age of at least 14 should be able to follow its main points.

## 2.9 Lawful Purpose and Special Category Data
DataShadow uses personal data for the purposes of identifying breaches and other digital risks.

Our legal ground for using the personal data collected by DataShadow is that doing so is necessary for the legitimate interests of our business or the legitimate interests of a third party such as our customers. We will not use personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests where an individual’s interests and rights override these.

Where a public body uses DataShadow as a customer, the legal ground may be for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or official authority.

Where DataShadow collects special category or criminal offence personal data, our legal ground is that doing so is necessary for the purposes of:
- Alerting the affected parties to the public nature of the data;
- The establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and/or
- Preventing or detecting unlawful acts.

Of the GDPR Article 6 lawful bases, our data processing satisfies one or more of the following:
(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
(d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
(e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

Of the GDPR Article 9 conditions, our reasons for processing this data satisfy:
(9.c) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;
(9.e) processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject;
(9.g) processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.

Of the 23 substantial public interest conditions set out in paragraphs 6 to 28 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018 (Act), these reasons fulfill:
(10) Preventing or detecting unlawful acts;
(11) Protecting the public;
(18) Safeguarding of children and individuals at risk; and/or
(19) Safeguarding of economic well-being of certain individuals.

We do not use any data for profiling unless given explicit consent by the data subject.

### 2.10.4 Purpose and lawful basis
The purpose for the data processing in Section ## 2.10 of this document is to maintain and monitor the performance of our website, to constantly look to improve the site and the services it offers to our users. The lawful basis we rely on to process your personal data is either Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR, for example when we require your consent for the optional cookies we use, or Article 6(1)(f) which allows us to process personal data when it’s necessary for our legitimate interests. For example in order to maintain the integrity of our IT systems and the continuity of our business.
