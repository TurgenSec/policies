# 1. Introduction 

During the course of its normal business activities, research and development, TurgenSec often discovers private data exposed publicly. This data is accessible to anyone looking in the right place, with no need for specialised tools or equipment. Following principles of responsible disclosure, TurgenSec seeks to bring data exposure to the attention of affected parties such that the impacted individuals may take steps to protect themselves against fraud, identity theft and other forms of attack.

When companies respond positively and promptly to such disclosures, remedying any defects and closing breaches, the data concerned is placed out of the reach of those with malicious intent. Thus TurgenSec seeks to avoid and reduce the inevitable leak of personal data into the dark web, underground forums and communities where it could be curated, traded and used to systematically exploit the data subjects. This public policy is to ensure that organisations we disclose to can understand our processes and the motivations behind our processes when dealing with data breach disclosures.

## 1.1 Primary Objectives
This policy sets out TurgenSec’s approach to disclosing security and data breaches to third parties and the public. It governs all such breaches, wherever discovered, worldwide.

The primary objectives are:
- The lawful, timely discovery of datasets containing personal information disclosed publicly in error, inadvertently or maliciously.
- The protection of the rights of individuals, in particular the right to privacy enshrined in data protection legislation internationally. Privacy is a fundamental human right in accordance with the UN Declaration of Human Rights, we seek to protect it.
- Timely and consistent communication with organisations found to be suffering from a security or data breach, however caused. Efforts will be made to make contact with the individuals or organisations affected by the breach in as timely and consistent fashion as possible in accordance with our public disclosure communication framework. These efforts will be documented and maintained. TurgenSec will not be held responsible should the notified party ignore or not respond to our communication attempts.
- The application of fair and ethical standards, which balance the rights of individuals and organisations. We look to work with organisations to create a more secure digital world where data rights are upheld and the security and correct handling of individuals’ data is performed in a transparent and informative way. 
- We will strongly encourage organisations to be transparent with impacted individuals as to the extent and content of the information breached. TurgenSec retains the right to inform impacted parties should this not take place or be deemed inaccurate. 
- Adherence to the letter and spirit of legislation protecting personal data and the rights of individuals.


## 1.2 Reasons to disclose
In all cases, it is TurgenSec’s duty to disclose a breach privately if possible (to the organisation responsible for the dataset) and publicly. The rationale for dual disclosure is set out below.

### 1.2.1 Private disclosure

It is inevitable and demonstrable that personal information will sometimes be made publicly available in a manner not intended by the organisation holding the dataset. Disclosing such discoveries directly to the organisation concerned enables the organisation to take all necessary remedial action. 

TurgenSec values cooperation and collaboration with breached organisations. Irrespective of the nature of communication during private disclosure, TurgenSec is committed to honest and transparent disclosure and will not make false or misleading statements about the organisation or the events that transpire throughout this process. 

The preferred outcome will always be:
1. TurgenSec privately disclose the breach to the impacted organisation.
2. The organisation fixes the breach in a timely manner, in accordance with the rights of the individuals impacted to minimise the time that the data is exposed to the public.
3. TurgenSec and the organisation mutually agree to public disclosure.

### 1.2.2 Public disclosure
As well as disclosing breaches to the organisation concerned, TurgenSec issues public disclosure notifications. There are several reasons for this:

- Public disclosure assists in bringing the breach to the attention of affected individuals, preferably with the cooperation of the organisation concerned.
- When it is impossible to identify the organisation responsible for the dataset, public disclosure brings a far wider pool (potentially including affected individuals) into identification efforts.
- Where organisations have failed to respond adequately to private disclosure in accordance with the primary objectives laid out at the start of this document, public disclosure has been seen to incentivise appropriate behaviour in the wider community. 
- TurgenSec believes wholeheartedly in transparency of its operations. Individuals’ privacy must be protected and their trust earned.
- Public disclosure raises awareness and scrutiny of breaches. This is a vital contributor to global efforts to ensure appropriate care is taken to secure data and protect the rights of individuals.
- Public disclosure helps prevent false information about the nature of the breach from spreading, whether this be intentional to harm the organisation involved, TurgenSec itself or its employees, to target individuals, or simply an accidental misinterpretation of events.

Additionally, TurgenSec urges breached organisations to issue their own public disclosure notices and can offer guidance and assistance free of charge if required.

# 2. Policy
## 2.1 Principles

1. Discovery activities are lawful and limited to publicly accessible services.
2. So far as practicable while working to best protect the impacted individuals, TurgenSec limits its own view of breached data.
3. Discovery activities are not to affect or interfere with the normal operation and use of the systems and data involved.
4. The data protection principle of minimisation is observed.
5. Disclosure will be as timely as resources permit.
6. Private disclosure will precede public disclosure wherever feasible.
7. Disclosure and discovery are not financially motivated. Bribery will not be tolerated.
8. Third parties may be engaged in the pursuit of a satisfactory outcome.

## 2.2 Discovery & disclosure

1. Any breach may already have been or could soon be discovered by those with malicious intent. With time being of the essence, TurrgenSec will carry out responsible disclosure as expeditiously as circumstances and resources permit.
2. TurgenSec’s discovery methodology will at all times be limited to tools and processes capable of discovering publicly available information with no credentials or authorisation required for access. For the avoidance of doubt, TurgenSec does not engage in reverse engineering, cracking, brute force password attacks or other ‘black hat’ techniques.
3. On discovering a potential breach, TurgenSec will take such steps as are necessary to satisfy itself that this is a breach of personal data. This includes spot-checking elements within the dataset to confirm its nature and content.
4. TurgenSec will make reasonable efforts to discover the identity of the organisation to whom the breached dataset belongs.
5. TurgenSec will make reasonable efforts to bring the fact of a breach to the attention of the organisation identified (if any) as the owner of the breached dataset.
6. TurgenSec will not request financial compensation for its disclosure; neither will it accept payment in return for suppressing information about the breach. 
7. In these efforts, TurgenSec may engage the assistance of reputable and/or official third parties, such as security researchers, lawyers, media, or law enforcement agencies.
8. TurgenSec will not retain data from breaches, except such redacted information as is required to demonstrate the fact and circumstances of the breach. This may include retaining, for example, screenshots with personal information obscured.
9. On notifying organisations of a breach, TurgenSec will wait a reasonable period before publicly disclosing the fact of the breach. The length of that waiting period will depend on factors such as the responsiveness of the notified organisation, the sensitivity of the data in the breach, the scope of the breach, the prominence of the organisation, and the risk to individuals, and will normally be in a range of 7 to 30 days.
10. If, in the view of TurgenSec, the organisation fails to act sufficiently swiftly or adequately, or fails to notify affected individuals appropriately, or if it is not possible to identify the organisation, in the interest of protecting those individuals, TurgenSec will publicly announce the details of the breach. These details will, where possible, include the identity of the organisation, the type of data breached, the technology affected, the length of time the dataset was exposed and the number of individuals affected.
11. Where the organisation’s response is appropriate, TurgenSec will work with the organisation to develop mutually acceptable public notices of breach, provided that TurgenSec will always favour full disclosure, for the protection of the rights of the individuals affected.
## 2.3 Breached organisations
1. Upon contact from TurrgenSec, organisations are expected to respond positively, with all due speed.
2. The organisation may at its sole discretion engage TurgenSec’s consultancy and security services on a commercial basis. Provision of such services is independent of disclosure processes and will not influence the timing, tone or content of any public disclosure by TurgenSec.
3. The waiting period following disclosure permits the organisation to satisfy itself of the fact of the breach and the veracity of TurgenSec's warnings, and to take such technical measures as are necessary to close the breach swiftly and to notify affected individuals.
4. The organisation should without unreasonable delay notify affected individuals of the breach.
5. The organisation is advised to disclose the breach publicly, incorporating assurances in relation to remediation and process improvement. Experience demonstrates that this enhances consumer confidence and is not to be feared, whilst attempts to conceal the extent of a breach are usually counterproductive.
6. In its own notice of breach, the organisation should give due and prominent acknowledgement of TurgenSec's efforts in bringing the breach to its attention.

## 2.4 Process
The process will vary with each incident, depending on the particular circumstances. The following is a representative model process:

1. TurgenSec discovers personal information publicly available and establishes that this is likely an inadvertent or malicious breach.
2. TurgenSec identifies the owner of the breach dataset.
3. TurgenSec contacts the organisation concerned, through officially published communication channels, with brief information, requesting appropriate contact details for further discussion.
4. In the event the organisation responds positively, TurgenSec will establish secure communication channels and provide full details about the breach.
5. If the organisation does not respond, successive communication attempts will follow an escalating pattern.
6. The organisation will expeditiously close the breach and inform affected individuals.
7. TurgenSec and the organisation will communicate further to discuss respective public disclosure notices.
8. Both parties issue their public notices.
