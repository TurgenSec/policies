# TurgenSec Anti-Bribery Statement
TurgenSec upholds our commitment to ethical business practices, including by prohibiting bribery and corruption. As [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/what-is-corruption#costs-of-corruption) explains, the costs of corruption are
- **political**, by posing a major obstacle to democracy and the rule of law
- **economic**, by depleting national wealth
- **social**, by undermining people’s trust in political society, institutions, and leaders
- **environmental**, by facilitating non-enforcement of environmental laws and regulations.

According to the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/governance/brief/anti-corruption) in 2017, businesses and individuals pay an estimated $1.5 trillion in bribes each year.

### TurgenSec policies prohibiting bribery

TurgenSec makes our anti-bribery commitment clear in a number of company policies.

TurgenSec's **Code of Ethics** prohibits employees and contractors from engaging in or contributing to bribery or corruption, and establishes record-keeping requirements:

>You must never pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, induce, accept, or authorize payment of anything else of value, to anyone—including to anyone in a position of power or authority, such as government officials, or in commercial transactions—in order to obtain or keep business, or secure any other improper advantage for TurgenSec. You also must not solicit or accept a bribe, kickback, or any other improper cash payment. ... [TurgenSec employees] are required to keep accurate and fair records of all transactions involving any expense made on TurgenSec’s behalf—for example, by keeping receipts and providing accurate descriptions of your expenses—or any other transaction involving the disposal or transfer of TurgenSec assets. Such actions are required by the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions in which TurgenSec does business and are also simply the right thing to do.

TurgenSec's Code of Ethics elaborates on certain situations, including gifts, travel, and entertainment; facilitating payments; charitable donations; jobs; and working with representatives, as well as on who is considered a government official.

TurgenSec's Standards of Conduct prohibit:
>Bribing government officials or other individuals to gain an unfair advantage, and taking bribes from anyone.

### Training for our employees

TurgenSec employees are required to participate in training on corruption, including bribery. We also provide additional training for particularly relevant people and teams, such as our sales team. The training explains relevant elements of the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. For example,
- definition and structural effects of corruption
- who is covered, including
   - public officials or others in a position of power
   - third parties
- what kind of activity is covered, including
   - cash, gifts, travel, and entertainment
   - facilitation payments
   - charitable contributions and sponsorship
- for what purpose, including
   - intent
   - improper advantage or influence
- due diligence and red flags
- record-keeping requirements

In addition, the training covers TurgenSec’s internal policies related to anti-corruption and bribery, including our non-retaliation (whistleblower) policy.

The U.K. Bribery Act extends to bribing anyone, regardless of whether they are a government official. It extends to TurgenSec’s actions anywhere on the globe. TurgenSec’s policies prohibit bribing anyone, anywhere in the world.
