## TurgenSec Privacy Statement

### What information TurgenSec collects

"**User Personal Information**" is any information about one of our Users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify them or otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with them. Information such as a username and password, an email address, a real name, an Internet protocol (IP) address, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.”

User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information that does not identify a User or cannot otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with them. We may use such aggregated, non-personally identifying information for research purposes and to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our Website and Service.

#### Information users provide directly to TurgenSec

#### *Registration Information*
We require some basic information at the time of account creation. When you create your own username and password, we ask you for a valid email address.

#### *Payment Information*
If you sign on to a paid Account with us, send funds through the TurgenSec Sponsors Program, we collect your full name, address, and credit card information or PayPal information. Please note, TurgenSec does not process or store your credit card information or PayPal information, but our third-party payment processor does.

#### Information TurgenSec automatically collects from your use of the Service

#### *Transactional Information*
If you have a paid Account with us, or contribute funds to us through our Referral Program, we automatically collect certain information about your transactions on the Service, such as the date, time, and amount charged.

#### *Usage Information*
If you're accessing our Service or Website, we automatically collect the same basic information that most services collect, subject, where necessary, to your consent. This includes information about how you use the Service, such as the pages you view, the referring site, your IP address and session information, and the date and time of each request. This is information we collect from every visitor to the Website, whether they have an Account or not. This information may include User Personal information.

#### *Cookies and Similar Technologies Information*
As further described below, and subject, where applicable, to your consent, we automatically collect information from cookies and similar technologies (such as cookie ID and settings) to keep you logged in, to remember your preferences, and to identify you and your device.

#### *Device Information*
We may collect certain information about your device, such as its IP address, browser or client application information, language preference, operating system and application version, device type and ID, and device model and manufacturer. This information may include User Personal information.

#### Information we collect from third parties

TurgenSec may collect User Personal Information from third parties. For example, this may happen if you sign up for training or to receive information about TurgenSec from one of our vendors, partners, or affiliates.

TurgenSec obtains OSINT data on a regular basis to help us provide our Services, which aim to identify and reduce Privacy-breaching data available freely on the internet. Therefore, we may collect your data during our routine research, and will only retain such information so much as it is necessary to restrict access to _others_ coming across it through the same methods known to us. Once all known risks of malicious parties obtaining this information are appropriately mitigated, we will destroy all information related to you.

### What information TurgenSec does not collect

We do not intentionally collect “**[Sensitive Personal Information](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/)**”, such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. We may obtain such information during OSINT gathering, and will only retain such information so much as it is necessary to restrict access to _others_ coming across it through the same methods we employed.

If you are a child under the age of 13, you may not have an Account on TurgenSec. TurgenSec does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. Please see our [Terms of Service](https://github.com/turgensec/policies/pending/turgensec-terms-of-service) for information about Account termination.

We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is stored in free-form content inputs.

### How TurgenSec uses your information

- We may use your information for the following purposes:
- We may come across your data during routine OSINT gathering; this is used to help improve your online privacy and cybersecurity. As soon as it is no longer a danger to others, we will tell you that we have come across your information. This is usually following a Data Breach Responsible Disclosure, which ensures your information is no longer accesible throught whatever means we acquired your data.
- We use your [Payment Information](#payment-information) to provide you with the Paid Account service, the Sponsors Program, or any other TurgenSec paid service you request.
- We use your User Personal Information, specifically your username, to identify you for contractual purposes.
- We use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, **and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay**. Please see our section on [email communication](#how-we-communicate-with-you) for more information.
- We use User Personal Information to respond to support requests.
- We use User Personal Information and other data to make recommendations for you, such as to suggest projects you may want to follow or contribute to. We learn from your public behavior on TurgenSec—such as the projects you star—to determine your coding interests, and we recommend similar projects. These recommendations are automated decisions, but they have no legal impact on your rights.
- We may use User Personal Information to invite you to take part in surveys, beta programs, or other research projects, subject, where necessary, to your consent.
- We use [Usage Information](#usage-information) and [Device Information](#device-information) to better understand how our Users use TurgenSec and to improve our Website and Service.
- We may use your User Personal Information if it is necessary for security purposes or to investigate possible fraud or attempts to harm TurgenSec or our Users.
- We may use your User Personal Information to comply with our legal obligations, protect our intellectual property, and enforce our [Terms of Service](https://github.com/turgensec/policies/pending/turgensec-terms-of-service).
- We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.

#### Our legal bases for processing information

To the extent that our processing of your User Personal Information is subject to certain international laws (including, but not limited to, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), TurgenSec is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information. TurgenSec processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:

- Contract Performance:
  * When you enter a contract with TurgenSec, either as a **User** or an **Organisation**, you provide your [Registration Information](#registration-information). We require this information for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process that information on the basis of performing that contract. We also process your username and email address on other legal bases, as described below.
  * If you have a paid Account (i.e. you are a **Customer**) with us, we collect and process additional [Payment Information](#payment-information) on the basis of performing that contract.
- Consent:
  * We rely on your consent to use your User Personal Information under the following circumstances: when you decide to participate in a TurgenSec training, research project, beta program, or surveys; and for marketing purposes, where applicable. All of this User Personal Information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time. While you are not able to delete your email address entirely, you can make it private. You may withdraw your consent at any time.
- Legitimate Interests:
  * Generally, the remainder of the processing of User Personal Information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interest, for example, for providing services to protect your privacy and cybersecurity, legal compliance purposes, security purposes, or to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of TurgenSec’s systems, Website, and Service.
- If you would like to request deletion of data we process on the basis of consent or if you object to our processing of personal information, please use our [Privacy contact form](https://support.TurgenSec.com/contact/privacy).

### How we share the information we collect

We may share your User Personal Information with third parties under one of the following circumstances:

#### With your consent

We share your User Personal Information, if you consent, after letting you know what information will be shared, with whom, and why. Additionally, you may direct us through your actions on TurgenSec to share your User Personal Information.

#### With service providers

We share User Personal Information with a limited number of service providers who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our Service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to the ones in our Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements or making similar commitments. Our service providers perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, security, and other similar services. While TurgenSec processes most User Personal Information in the European Union, our service providers may process data outside of the European Union or the United States. If you would like to know who our service providers are, please send an email to our [research team](mailto:research@turgensec.com).

#### For security purposes

If you are a member of an Organization, TurgenSec may share your username, [Usage Information](#usage-information), and [Device Information](#device-information) associated with that Organization with an owner and/or administrator of the Organization who has agreed to the Corporate Terms of Service or applicable customer agreements, to the extent that such information is provided only to investigate or respond to a security incident that affects or compromises the security of that particular Organization.

#### For legal disclosure
TurgenSec strives for transparency in complying with legal process and legal obligations. Unless prevented from doing so by law or court order, or in rare, exigent circumstances, we make a reasonable effort to notify users of any legally compelled or required disclosure of their information. TurgenSec may disclose User Personal Information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement if required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search warrant, a similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.

For more information about our disclosure in response to legal requests, see our [Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data](https://github.com/turgensec/policies/pending/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data).

#### Change in control or sale
We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our Website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we made in our Privacy Statement or Terms of Service.

#### Aggregate, non-personally identifying information
We share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use TurgenSec, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events. For example, we may compile statistics on the open source data collected by TurgenSec.

We **do not** sell your User Personal Information for monetary or other consideration.

Please note: The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) requires businesses to state in their privacy policy whether or not they disclose personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. While CCPA only covers California residents, when it goes into effect we will voluntarily extend its core rights for people to control their data to _all_ of our users, not just those who live in California. You can learn more about the CCPA and how we comply with it [here](https://github.com/turgensec/policies/turgensecs-notice-about-the-california-consumer-privacy-act).

### Other important information

#### Repository contents

TurgenSec personnel [do not access private repositories unless required to](https://github.com/turgensec/policies/pending/turgensec-terms-of-service#e-private-repositories) for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, or to comply with our legal obligations. However, while we do not generally search for content in your repositories, we may scan our servers and content to detect certain tokens or security signatures, known active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms, such as violent extremist or terrorist content or child exploitation imagery, based on algorithmic fingerprinting techniques. Our Terms of Service provides [more details](https://github.com/turgensec/policies/[ending/turgensec-terms-of-service#e-private-repositories).

If your repository is public, anyone may view its contents. If you include private, confidential or [Sensitive Personal Information](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/), such as email addresses or passwords, in your public repository, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.

Please see more about [User Personal Information in public repositories](https://github.com/turgensec/policies/pending/turgensec-privacy-statement#public-information-on-turgensec).

### How you can access and control the information we collect

If you're already a TurgenSeIf TurgenSec processes information about you, such as information [TurgenSec receives from third parties](#information-we-collect-from-third-parties), and you do not have an account, then you may, subject to applicable law, access, update, alter, delete, or object to the processing of your personal information by contacting the [TurgenSec DPO](dpo@turgensec.com).

#### Data retention and deletion of data

Generally, TurgenSec retains User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide our services.


If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do by sending a deletion request to our DPO. 

We retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete all information relating to you (within reason) within 90 days of your request. You may contact our [DPO](dpo@turgensec.com) to request the erasure of the data we process on the basis of consent within 30 days.

### Our use of cookies and tracking

#### Cookies

TurgenSec uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. Cookies are small text files that websites often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of TurgenSec. For security purposes, we use cookies to identify a device. By using our Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept these cookies, you will not be able to log in or use TurgenSec’s services.

We provide a web page on [cookies and tracking](https://github.com/turgensec/policies/pending/turgensec-subprocessors-and-cookies) that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the types of cookies they are (temporary or permanent). It also lists our third-party analytics providers and other service providers, and details exactly which parts of our Website we permit them to track.

#### Tracking and analytics

We use a number of third-party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our Users' use of TurgenSec, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and Website performance. We only use these third-party analytics providers on certain areas of our Website, and all of them have signed data protection agreements with us that limit the type of User Personal Information they can collect and the purpose for which they can process the information. In addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our content and performance.

Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. TurgenSec responds to browser DNT signals and follows the [W3C standard for responding to DNT signals](https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/). If you have not enabled DNT on a browser that supports it, cookies on some parts of our Website will track your online browsing activity on other online services over time, though we do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track TurgenSec Users' activity over time on TurgenSec.

### How TurgenSec secures your information

TurgenSec takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information.

TurgenSec enforces a written security information program. Our program:
- aligns with industry recognized frameworks;
- includes security safeguards reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of our Users' data;
- is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of TurgenSec’s business operations;
- includes incident response and data breach notification processes; and
- complies with applicable information security-related laws and regulations in the geographic regions where TurgenSec does business.

In the event of a data breach that affects your User Personal Information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach and notify any affected Users without undue delay.

Transmission of data on TurgenSec is encrypted using SSH, HTTPS (TLS), and all data encrypted at rest. When data is stored with a third-party storage provider, it is encrypted.

### TurgenSec's global privacy practices

We provide a high standard of privacy protection—as described in this Privacy Statement—to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business, working with our Data Protection Officer as part of a cross-functional team that oversees our privacy compliance efforts. Additionally, if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must sign agreements that require them to comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws.

In particular:

 - TurgenSec provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed, specific, and freely given consent at the time of data collection, when we collect your User Personal Information using consent as a basis.
 - We collect only the minimum amount of User Personal Information necessary for our purposes, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.
 - We offer you simple methods of accessing, altering, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected, where legally permitted.
 - We provide our Users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access regarding their User Personal Information, and we limit the purpose for processing it. We also provide our Users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are also just good practices.

### How we communicate with you

We use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, **and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay**. For example, if you contact our team with a request, we respond to you via email.

### Resolving complaints

If you have concerns about the way TurgenSec is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help.

You may also contact our Data Protection Officer [directly](dpo@TurgenSec.com).

### Changes to our Privacy Statement

Although most changes are likely to be minor, TurgenSec may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the primary email address specified in your TurgenSec account.
