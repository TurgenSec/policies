# Policies

The team at TurgenSec strongly believe in transparency and openness. This is
reflected in our policies and our practice. Accordingly we publish as many of our
policies as feasible on GitHub. Notable exceptions will be policies for
internal-only use and/or those with particular sensitivity.

Our policies on GitHub are open-source under under [CC0-1.0](LICENSE.MD). You may
use and repurpose them however you wish, provided that you do not charge for
their use. Bear in mind that these policies are specific to TurgenSec, so any
further use is likely to require adapatation.

# Important notes

- These policies do not constitute legal advice. TurgenSec is not a law firm.
- We regret we are not able to offer advice or assistance in your use of these
  policies.
- You should consult a lawyer or policy specialist, if adapting these policies
  to your own organisation.
